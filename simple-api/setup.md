npm init -y    # To initialize a package.json file if we haven't already
npm install express   # To install Express.js

Create an app.js file and define apis

 start the app by node app.js




### 1. **`npm init -y`**
When we run `npm init`, it starts the process of creating a `package.json` file for our  project. The `-y` flag automatically answers “yes” to all the prompts that `npm init` asks (such as name, version, description, etc.), and it generates the `package.json` file with default values. If we run `npm init` without `-y`, it will ask for these details interactively.

Example:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command creates a `package.json` file with default values like this:

```json
{
  "name": "our-project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

This `package.json` file contains metadata about our  project (e.g., name, version, scripts, dependencies, etc.) and is crucial for managing dependencies and running scripts in a Node.js project.

### 2. **What is `package.json`?**

The `package.json` file is the heart of a Node.js project. It contains important information about our  project and its dependencies. Here’s what it typically includes:

- **Name**: The name of our  project.
- **Version**: The current version of our  project.
- **Dependencies**: A list of packages our  project depends on, like `express`, `mongoose`, etc.
- **Scripts**: Custom scripts to run tasks like starting the server, running tests, etc. (e.g., `npm start`).
- **License**: The license under which the project is released.

For example, after installing a dependency like `express`, our  `package.json` will look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "our -project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  }
}
```

### 3. **What is `package-lock.json`?**

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated when we install dependencies using `npm install`. It contains the exact versions of the dependencies and their dependencies that were installed.

The main difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` is that:

- `package.json` defines **which packages** our  project needs, but not the exact versions.
- `package-lock.json` records **the exact version** of each installed package and their transitive dependencies, ensuring that the same versions are installed across all environments (development, production, CI/CD, etc.).

#### Why `package-lock.json` is important:

1. **Consistency**: It ensures that everyone working on the project (or any CI/CD environment) will get the same exact versions of dependencies. Without it, different developers could get different versions of the same package if there are updates available.
  
2. **Performance**: It speeds up the `npm install` process because it already knows exactly which versions to install.

#### Example of `package-lock.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "our -project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 1,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "4.17.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.17.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-X4t66ESmI4...etc..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Takeaways:

- **`npm init -y`** creates a `package.json` file automatically with default values.
- **`package.json`** is the file that holds metadata about our  project, including its dependencies and other important information.
- **`package-lock.json`** is automatically generated when installing packages and ensures that all developers and environments use the same exact versions of dependencies, maintaining consistency.

In summary, `package.json` is like the blueprint of our  project’s dependencies, while `package-lock.json` is like the blueprint of the **exact version** of the dependencies, ensuring consistency.
